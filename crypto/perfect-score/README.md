## Idea
This challenge will be to decrypt a text file that has been encrypted using the vigen√®re cipher. The key will be a short string (probably like 4-6 characters), and the plaintext is the answers to an exam!
## Motivation
You have intercepted a file which you believe contains the answers to your upcoming Computer Science final. Unfortunatly, the file appears to be encrypted! Break the encryption to gain access to the key.
