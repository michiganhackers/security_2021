# easy-encoding  
Contributors: Justin Hutchins  
Idea: A straightforward reverse engineering challenge where an encoded flag and the encoder are provided. Can be ssolved using brute force, by generating and encoding strings until a match is found, or by writing a decoder, whicch is relatively easy after seeing that the encoding relies on reversible XOR operations.
