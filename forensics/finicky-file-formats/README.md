Idea: This challenge took a pdf file in which the flag was listed and changed the file extension to .jpg. If you open the jpg file in a hex-editor (or notepad) you will see the file signature is PDF. Simply changing the file extension of hte file to .pdf will fix the file and allow you to open up the pdf file and read the flag.
